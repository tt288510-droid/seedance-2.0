# seedance-audio

Use this for dialogue, lip-sync, sound layers, music, ambience, beat-sync, audio-reference mapping, desync troubleshooting, or sound-driven visual timing. Audio should support the visible beat instead of becoming a second competing prompt.

Load `[ref:audio-guide]` for detailed constraints, beat-sync, desync repair, audio-reference conflicts, and multi-character workarounds.

## Core Rules

Keep dialogue short, quote spoken lines, and assign every line to a named speaker. Prefer locked or stable framing for lip-sync. Remove head-turning, large face motion, extreme camera moves, or busy hand gestures while mouth accuracy matters. Treat `[Audio1]` as a rhythm, pacing, mood, voice-tone, or ambience reference unless the active platform documents exact playback behavior.

## Sound Layer Pattern

Use compact layers: `Dialogue: ... Sound: ... SFX: ... Music: ... Silence: ...`. Include only the layers that matter. Silence is valid when it sharpens drama or avoids confusing lip-sync.

| Need | Stable audio direction |
|---|---|
| Lip-sync | `Character A, locked medium close-up, says "I found it." Clear dry dialogue, no head turn.` |
| Product ad | `Sound: low room tone. SFX: magnetic click on lid open, soft glass chime at final frame.` |
| Beat sync | `[Audio1] provides tempo only; light pulses and foot taps match the downbeat.` |
| Drama | `Distant rain and refrigerator hum; no music during the line.` |
| Action | `Breathing grows louder, shoe squeak at landing, metal door buzzer at endpoint.` |

## Multi-Character Dialogue

Use one speaker per short clip when reliability matters. If two characters must speak, separate turns and keep the camera stable: `Character A says... pause. Character B answers...`. For complex exchanges, recommend generating controlled single-speaker clips and compositing in post.

## Failure Fixes

If dialogue desyncs, shorten the line, lock the camera, remove head turns, clean the audio role, and reduce competing SFX. If the wrong speaker talks, assign tags and split lines by speaker. If audio is ignored, remove extra music/SFX instructions and make the reference role explicit.

If audio and video references fight each other, mute the reference video before upload when possible, or make the priority explicit: `[Video1] controls camera only; [Audio1] controls tempo and energy`.

## Output Contract

Return speaker map, quoted dialogue, sound layers, audio reference role, lip-sync constraints, and a compact prompt-ready audio block.
