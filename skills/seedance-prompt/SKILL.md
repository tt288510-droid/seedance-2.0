# seedance-prompt

Build production-ready Seedance prompts from clear concepts or supplied reference assets. Treat the prompt as a short shooting brief: it must say what changes on screen, what the camera does, what the light and sound contribute, and what must stay stable. Keep final prompts under the platform prompt budget and remove filler before delivery.

Load `[ref:quick-ref]` for the checklist, `[ref:reference-workflow]` for multimodal references, `[ref:i2v-guide]` for image-to-video, `[ref:first-last-frame-guide]` for first/last-frame work, `[ref:examples-by-mode]` when examples are useful, and `[ref:multilingual-community-examples]` for Chinese/Russian/Japanese/Korean/Spanish or mixed-language prompts.

## Director Formula

Use `Subject + Action + Scene + Camera + Lighting/Style + Audio + Constraints`. Put the subject and primary action first because early clauses set the shot hierarchy. Do not force every slot if a reference asset already shows the information; for I2V, describe only the motion, camera, timing, transformation, audio, and preservation constraints that the still image cannot show.

| Slot | Use for | Prompt-ready pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Subject | The anchor the model must track. | `Original ceramic perfume bottle on black acrylic, label preserved exactly` |
| Action | The visible change. | `condensation beads form and slide down the glass over five seconds` |
| Scene | Only what is not already in references. | `quiet rain-lit kitchen counter, shallow depth of field` |
| Camera | One primary move with endpoint. | `slow dolly-in from medium product shot to macro label detail` |
| Light and style | Physical light plus safe visual language. | `warm practical key from frame left, cool blue rim, clean commercial realism` |
| Audio | Ambient bed, SFX, dialogue, or silence. | `Sound: low room tone, soft glass chime on final frame` |
| Constraints | Preservation and exclusions. | `do not alter logo, shape, label, or cap geometry` |

## Mode Gate

Choose the mode before drafting. **T2V** needs subject, action, scene, camera, light, style, and constraints because nothing is visible yet. **I2V** starts from `[Image1]` and adds only motion, time, camera, lighting transition, audio, and preservation. **V2V** should map `[Video1]` to source clip, camera move, action rhythm, blocking, edit target, or extension anchor rather than accidentally transferring identity. **R2V** must list every reference role and state what must not transfer. **FLF2V** uses `[Image1]` as first frame and `[Image2]` as last frame, then describes only the continuous transition.

| Mode | Drafting priority | Common mistake | Repair |
|---|---|---|---|
| T2V | Build the whole shot in compact layers. | Too many events in one clip. | Keep one visible beat and one endpoint. |
| I2V | Preserve visible identity; add motion. | Re-describing the image until the product or face drifts. | Say `preserve [Image1] exactly`; add only dynamic changes. |
| V2V | Transfer motion, camera, or timing. | Copying unauthorized likeness or scene details. | Use owned/licensed/authorized references and restrict transfer role. |
| R2V | Assign separate roles to each asset. | One reference asked to control identity, pose, scene, and style. | Split roles or prioritize the most important role. |
| FLF2V | Move from first frame to last frame. | Treating the last frame as vague mood instead of endpoint. | State `[Image2]` is the final visual target. |
| Edit | Preserve the source clip while changing one layer. | Rewriting the whole scene and losing continuity. | Say `[Video1] is the source clip; change only...` |
| Extend | Continue from the existing final state. | Starting a new scene after the clip. | Use the last frame as continuity anchor and change one variable. |

## Prompt Build Process

First, identify the single visible beat: reveal, arrival, decision, transformation, contact, pursuit, or disappearance. Next, assign reference roles before adding adjectives. Then write a compact first draft in the director formula order. Finally, run a self-check: one main subject, one main action, one main camera move, physical lighting, assigned character tags, sound intent, and no hollow boosters.

## Compression Rules

When the prompt is too long, cut in this order: duplicate style adjectives, generic quality words, background details visible in references, secondary camera moves, secondary actions, and speculative emotional labels. Keep preservation constraints, action timing, and role maps. If a user requests a bilingual or mixed-language prompt, use language mixing only for clarity: reference roles, dialogue language, technical camera terms, and safe production constraints. Do not use another language to hide unsafe intent.

## Output Contract

Return:

1. Mode: T2V, I2V, V2V, R2V, FLF2V, edit, or extend.
2. Reference role map, if any.
3. Final prompt under 2000 characters.
4. Optional Chinese compressed version when useful.
5. Safety or copyright note when relevant.

Before finalizing, run an anti-slop pass and remove vague quality boosters.
