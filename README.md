## Why this repository exists

Seedance 2.0 Skill OS is a modular agent-skill package for directing Seedance 2.0 video generations. It is built around a simple principle: **direct the model, do not micro-manage the frame**.

The repository gives an AI assistant a public, auditable operating system for Seedance work. It defines when to interview, when to write a compact prompt, when to load a technical reference, when to rewrite unsafe IP content, and when to troubleshoot a bad generation.

## What This Skill Does

This skill package turns Seedance 2.0 work into a repeatable assistant workflow:

- Routes vague ideas into short creative interviews instead of premature prompt dumps.
- Writes full or compressed prompts for T2V, I2V, V2V, R2V, FLF2V, edit, extend, audio-aware, and first/last-frame workflows.
- Separates every reference asset by role: identity, environment, motion, camera rhythm, audio tempo, style, or endpoint.
- Keeps model and platform claims source-dated so API, pricing, region, quota, and model-ID details are not guessed.
- Provides deeper multilingual cinematic vocabulary in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and Russian, including role binding, first/last-frame phrasing, edit/extend wording, safety wording, and audio cues.
- Adds original community-informed examples for Chinese-English, Russian-English, Japanese-English, Korean-English, and Spanish-English prompt structures.
- Handles safe false-positive repairs by clarifying benign production context, not by hiding unsafe intent.
- Rewrites unsafe celebrity, protected IP, private-person, brand, logo, song, or voice requests into safer creative equivalents.
- Diagnoses failed outputs with concrete repair levers: camera, lighting, motion, reference role, duration, framing, audio, or safety wording.
- Ships validation scripts, eval cases, source data, and design checks so maintainers can review changes before release.

## Start Here

| User situation | Load first | Output |
|---|---|---|
| “I have a vague idea.” | [`seedance-interview`](skills/seedance-interview/SKILL.md) | A focused creative brief and next prompt path. |
| “I know the scene I want.” | [`seedance-prompt`](skills/seedance-prompt/SKILL.md) | A production-ready Seedance prompt. |
| “Make it short and strong.” | [`seedance-prompt-short`](skills/seedance-prompt-short/SKILL.md) | A compressed 30–100 word prompt. |
| “I have an image/video/audio reference.” | [`reference-workflow`](references/reference-workflow.md) | A role map for every reference asset. |
| “Use this as first frame and that as final frame.” | [`first-last-frame-guide`](references/first-last-frame-guide.md) | A continuous transition with endpoint locks. |
| “It failed or looks bad.” | [`seedance-troubleshoot`](skills/seedance-troubleshoot/SKILL.md) | A root-cause diagnosis and repaired prompt. |
| “This uses a character, brand, celebrity, or real person.” | [`seedance-copyright`](skills/seedance-copyright/SKILL.md) | A safer rewrite preserving the creative function. |
| “I need API, Runway, pricing, model ID, or production workflow guidance.” | [`api-workflow`](references/api-workflow.md) | A source-gated operational checklist. |
| “Is this Seedance Pro/Fast/V2?” | [`model-name-map`](references/model-name-map.md) | Source-dated naming and surface caveats. |
| “I want Chinese/Russian/Japanese/Korean/Spanish or mixed-language prompt examples.” | [`multilingual-community-examples`](references/multilingual-community-examples.md) | Safe community-informed structures and false-positive repair patterns. |
| “I am installing or reviewing this as an agent skill.” | [`agent-compatibility`](references/agent-compatibility.md) | Codex/Agent Skills structure and distribution notes. |

## Current Status Rule

Seedance platform behavior changes quickly. Before making factual claims about API availability, face or portrait authorization, upload limits, pricing, regional availability, or model names, load [`references/api-status.md`](references/api-status.md) and check its `last_verified` date.

As of 2026-05-30, public official sources describe Seedance 2.0 as supporting text, image, audio, and video inputs. Official launch and model-card material says references can include up to 9 images, 3 video clips, and 3 audio clips.

Volcengine's May 29 docs keep `doubao-seedance-2-0-260128` and `doubao-seedance-2-0-fast-260128` visible as current Ark model IDs and document first/last-frame role usage on that surface. Runway documents `seedance2` with 5-15 second duration and optional image, video, and audio references.

Access, pricing, upload limits, regions, resolution, audio-combination rules, and authorization requirements remain surface-specific.

## Research Snapshot

The v5.4 release line adds a dated research layer for safer data mining and platform claims:

- [`research-2026-05-30.md`](references/research-2026-05-30.md) records official and field-observed signals.
- [`platform-surface-matrix.md`](references/platform-surface-matrix.md) separates model capability from Dreamina/Jimeng, Volcengine/Ark, BytePlus, ComfyUI, and wrapper behavior.
- [`model-name-map.md`](references/model-name-map.md) prevents `Seedance 2.0`, `Seedance 2.0 Fast`, `Seedance V2`, and ambiguous Pro labels from being mixed together.
- [`community-source-methodology.md`](references/community-source-methodology.md) explains how to mine public prompt corpora without copying unsafe examples.
- [`multilingual-community-examples.md`](references/multilingual-community-examples.md) captures safe mixed-language and localized prompt structures from community pattern mining.

## Operating System At A Glance

![Seedance 2.0 Skill OS infographic: source registry, prompt router, multimodal references, safety gates, and eval loop](assets/skill-os-infographic.png)

The visual map is intentionally text-light so it remains clean in GitHub and reusable in docs. It represents the five lanes this package keeps separate:

- Research sources: dated official, academic, platform, and community evidence.
- Prompt router: interview, prompt writing, compression, recipes, and troubleshooting.
- Multimodal references: image, video, audio, first-frame, last-frame, and role-bound assets.
- Safety gates: IP, likeness, voice, brand, real-person, filter, and platform-policy checks.
- Quality evals: schema checks, source freshness, vocabulary integrity, design audit, and behavior cases.

## Install

Client support for Agent Skills is still tool-specific. Codex documents a skill as a directory with a required `SKILL.md`, optional `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`, and optional `agents/` metadata.

Codex scans `.agents/skills` locations from the working directory upward, plus user/admin/system skill locations. A repository root with `SKILL.md` is shaped like a skill folder, but it still needs to be installed/copied under a scanned skills directory or distributed as a plugin for automatic discovery.

This repository keeps dense facts in references so the active skill stays small.

If your client supports installing a skill directly from a GitHub repository, use this repository URL:

```text
https://github.com/Emily2040/seedance-2.0
```

For manual installation, copy this repository into the skill directory used by your agent client. The directory name should match the root skill name, `seedance-20`. Treat the table below as common local targets to verify in your own client, not a universal support guarantee.

| Platform | Typical workspace path |
|---|---|
| Claude Code / OpenClaw | `.claude/skills/seedance-20/` |
| Codex-style agent workspace | `.agents/skills/seedance-20/` |
| Gemini CLI-style workspace | `.gemini/skills/seedance-20/` |
| GitHub Copilot workspace | `.github/skills/seedance-20/` |
| Cursor workspace | `.cursor/skills/seedance-20/` |
| Windsurf workspace | `.windsurf/skills/seedance-20/` |

## Validation

Run these checks before every release:

```bash
python scripts/validate_skills.py --strict
python scripts/content_audit.py --strict
python scripts/eval_schema_check.py --strict
python scripts/design_audit.py --strict
python scripts/source_registry_check.py --strict
python scripts/vocab_schema_check.py --strict
```

The CI workflow runs the same checks on push and pull request.

## Design Standard

The v5.4 front page uses a generated cinematic bitmap hero, a generated operating-system infographic, a generated cinematic skill-map infographic, and the cleaned v5.2 information architecture. The README should stay readable in GitHub mobile, dark mode, and narrow widths. SVG assets must include `<title>` and `<desc>` elements, use internal CSS only, and avoid external fonts or scripts. See [`docs/frontend-redesign.md`](docs/frontend-redesign.md).

## Changelog

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). Current release: **v5.4.3**.
