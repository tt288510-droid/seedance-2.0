# seedance-pipeline

Use this for operational workflows, APIs, web surfaces, post-production, and integration planning.

## Status Rule

Always load `[ref:api-status]` for current API and platform claims. Load `[ref:model-name-map]` when a user says Pro, Fast, V2, or a wrapper model ID. Do not rely on old release-status memory.
Load `[ref:api-workflow]` for implementation planning, task lifecycle, Runway/Volcengine field differences, pricing caveats, upload handling, and production readiness.

## Workflow Split

1. Web workflow: Dreamina/Jimeng surface, references, prompt, output review.
2. API workflow: Volcengine, BytePlus, or Runway docs, model ID, auth, file handling, task creation, polling/querying, cancellation/deletion, task ledger, and retrieval.
3. Post workflow: stitching, audio cleanup, captions, color, upscale, delivery.
4. First/last-frame workflow: map first frame, last frame, transition action, identity locks, and ending target.
5. Runway workflow: model `seedance2`, `runway://` uploads, audio-reference combination rules, plan/region caveats, and SDK type lag are Runway-specific.
6. Community workflow: ComfyUI or unofficial nodes must be labeled community/unverified unless sourced.
7. Corpus-mining workflow: classify sources before reuse; extract structure and vocabulary, not unsafe raw prompts.

## Output Contract

Return the workflow path, source status, required inputs, validation steps, and risks.
