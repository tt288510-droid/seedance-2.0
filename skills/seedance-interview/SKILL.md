# seedance-interview

Use this as the full director interview when the user has a rough idea rather than a ready scene.

## Process

1. Build a safe draft premise immediately from the user input.
2. Ask only the missing questions that materially affect the prompt: subject, action, reference assets, camera feel, emotional direction, duration, and risk constraints.
3. Identify the genre path: product, lifestyle, drama, music video, landscape, commercial, animation, UGC, or experimental.
4. End with a concise creative brief and route to `[skill:seedance-prompt]` or `[skill:seedance-prompt-short]`.

## Output Contract

Return: concept summary, reference asset request, core scene, mood, camera intent, sound intent, safety notes, and next prompt path.

Do not ask a long questionnaire when the user already supplied enough information to write the prompt.
