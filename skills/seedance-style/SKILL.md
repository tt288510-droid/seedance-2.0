# seedance-style

Translate style requests into production descriptors. Style should describe medium, texture, palette, lens or render behavior, period cues, and composition. Do not rely on studio, franchise, artist, or living-creator names when a safer descriptive style can preserve the user's intent.

## Style Safety Rule

Do not use studio, franchise, artist, or living-creator names as style anchors unless the user has a clearly authorized workflow. Preserve the intended visual function by describing medium, texture, palette, lighting, composition, era, line quality, and motion rhythm.

| User intent | Safe production descriptor |
|---|---|
| Cozy hand-drawn fantasy | `hand-painted 2D animation, soft watercolor backgrounds, rounded character silhouettes, warm pastel palette, gentle parallax` |
| Sharp cyberpunk action | `neon noir city, wet pavement reflections, high-contrast magenta and cyan light, fast lateral tracking, angular silhouettes` |
| Premium product realism | `clean commercial realism, controlled reflections, shallow depth of field, neutral background, polished material detail` |
| Retro documentary | `1970s documentary texture, muted film grain, practical daylight, handheld observational framing` |
| Children's animation | `soft clay-like characters, simple expressive faces, bright primary palette, bouncy squash-and-stretch motion` |

## Layered Style Method

Separate style into layers instead of one broad label: **medium** (live action, stop-motion, 2D, 3D, miniature), **surface** (paper grain, clay, brushed metal, glass, fabric), **palette** (pastel, monochrome, sodium orange), **camera/render** (macro, shallow focus, orthographic, handheld), and **motion rhythm** (gentle, staccato, elastic, realistic weight).

## Hybrid Style Rule

If the user asks for a hybrid, assign each style to a layer: `live-action product photography with illustrated UI overlays` is clearer than mixing many named influences. Keep character design, environment, lighting, and VFX in compatible registers.

## Output Contract

Return a safe style descriptor, any protected-name rewrite, and one integrated prompt sentence.
