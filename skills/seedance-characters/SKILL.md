# seedance-characters

Use this for identity, consistency, multi-character blocking, wardrobe continuity, hand safety, expression control, and likeness-sensitive character guidance. Character prompting must remove ambiguity before adding style.

## Character Contract

Assign each character a stable tag: `Character A`, `Character B`, `[Image1] subject`, or a user-provided original name. After more than one character appears, do not use ambiguous pronouns. Keep tag, role, appearance, wardrobe, position, action, and emotional beat consistent.

| Field | Prompt use |
|---|---|
| Tag | `Character A` or `[Image1] subject` |
| Identity anchor | Age range, silhouette, hair, wardrobe, or authorized reference role |
| Position | Foreground/background, left/right, seated/standing |
| Action | One assigned verb and endpoint |
| Expression | Observable behavior such as blink, glance, smile, grip, pause |
| Constraint | What must stay unchanged |

## Multi-Character Blocking

Assign actions separately: `Character A lowers the envelope; Character B remains in the doorway`. Do not write `they argue dramatically` when the model must decide who moves. If contact occurs, describe the contact point and endpoint. For crowd scenes, identify the hero subject and keep background motion simple.

## Hand and Face Stability

Hands and faces degrade under complex choreography. Keep hands visible but simple, avoid rapid finger actions, avoid face-touching during dialogue, and lock the camera for lip-sync or portrait preservation. Use props to show emotion when facial precision is fragile.

## Likeness Rule

For real-person likeness, do not infer consent from an uploaded asset. Treat portrait, face, and voice workflows as authorization-dependent and surface-specific. If authorization is unclear, rewrite to an original character archetype while preserving the scene function.

## Output Contract

Return a character card, tag map, action assignments, continuity constraints, and any safety or authorization note.
